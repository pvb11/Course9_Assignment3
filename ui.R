    'The rock dataset consists of 48 rock sample measurements from a petroleum reservoir. Twelve core samples from petroleum reservoirs were sampled by 4 cross-sections. Each core sample was measured for permeability, and each cross-section has total area of pores, total perimeter of pores, and shape.'
