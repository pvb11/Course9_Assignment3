The purpose of this document is to provide user support for the Shiny application hosted at: https://pvb11.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/

All of the R code used for this project is found in this git repository in the server.R and ui.R files.

This application deploys k-means clustering on the 'rock' dataset. On the webpage, the user can select which variables to compare, as well as the number of clusters to display.

The rock dataset consists of 48 rock sample measurements from a petroleum reservoir. Twelve core samples from petroleum reservoirs were sampled by 4 cross-sections. Each core sample was measured for permeability, and each cross-section has total area of pores, total perimeter of pores, and shape. The four numeric features in the dataset are described below.

'area' - area of pores space, in pixels out of 256 by 256
'peri' - perimeter in pixels
'shape' - perimeter/sqrt(area)
'perm' - permeability of core sample
